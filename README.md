# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Assignment for the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project" from the Johns Hopkins University Coursera class. 

## Instructions

1. Execute the `run_analysis.R` R script by running the following command: `r -f run_analysis.R`.
1. By the ebd of execution, two files should have been generated in the workspace root folder:
  1. **tidy_data.csv**: the tidy data version of the source data set
  1. **tidy_data_mean.csv**: the summarized version of averaged standard deviations and averaged means of the metrics by group and activity.

## Files

#### CodeBook.md

The code book that explains the tidy data produced by this cleaning R script. 

#### run_analysis.R

The R script performing the cleaning process for the *Human Activity Recognition* data set. 

#### uci_har_dataset.zip
